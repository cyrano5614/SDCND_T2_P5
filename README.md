## Implementation

### Results
See the result of this implementation [here](https://youtu.be/VSGNypxmx4U).

### The Model
The MPC model consists of 4 variables in our state.

* x = x position of the vehicle in global coordinate
* y = y position of the vehicle in global coordinate
* psi = orientation of the vehicle 
* v = velocity of the vehicle

The information is taken from the simulator directly through uWebSockets.

In our MPC model, the actuators that had effect was wheel directions and engine speed which we represented as:

* Î´ = steering angle of the vehicle
* a = acceleration of the vehicle

Another variable that we used in our model was the measure of the distance between the front of the vehicle and its center of gravity.

* Lf = constant distance to CoG

Now that we have all the variables in the state defined in our model, let's look at how to update them.

* x_[t+1] = x[t] + v[t] * cos(psi[t]) * dt
* y_[t+1] = y[t] + v[t] * sin(psi[t]) * dt
* psi_[t+1] = psi[t] + v[t] / Lf * delta[t] * dt
* v_[t+1] = v[t] + a[t] * dt
* cte[t+1] = f(x[t]) - y[t] + v[t] * sin(epsi[t]) * dt
* epsi[t+1] = psi[t] - psides[t] + v[t] * delta[t] / Lf * dt

In addition to the previously mentioned variables in our state, two more update equations were used to update crosstrack error and orientation error. 

### Time Step & Length
The N value is the number of steps to look ahead to predict and dt is the elapsed time between each steps.  The product of N and dt results in T value which is the time frame that the model predicts ahead.  For example, if N is 20 and dt is 0.1, than the T will result in 2 seconds which means our model is predicting events upto 2 seconds out.  

N value of 10 and dt value of 0.1 was used with N * dt = 1.  Our model will look ahead for 1 second as high speed and rapid turns makes looking further ahead meaningless in dramatically changing situations.  Few more test runs with different settings were tried with N = 20, dt = 0.05, T = 1 but that model was not as stable as the previous model.

### Polymonial Fitting & MPC Preprocessing
From the data package from uWebSocket, waypoints of x and y global coordinates are received and vector object is created.  Using the waypoints and the position of the vehicle in global coordinates, we convert the coordinates to vehicle coordinates to make our calculations easier in our future calculations.  

* double dx = ptsx[i] - px;
* double dy = ptsy[i] - py;
* ptsx_agent[i] = dx * cos(-psi) - dy * sin(-psi);
* ptsy_agent[i] = dx * sin(-psi) + dy * cos(-psi);

After we convert the waypoints in vehicle coordinates, we use the polyfit function to fit the coordinates and extract coefficients which is used in polyeval function to calculate crosstrack error value and orientation error value.  

### MPC with Latency
In this simulation, latency of 100ms was used to mimic the real life delay between calculation and actuation in the vehicle.  In real life, when the measurement is taken from sensors and processed in the computer and ready to signal actuation, the vehicle has already moved into different state which makes the actuations not accurate.  Implementing the latency will compensate for this lost time between the processes so the system can be modeled with accuracy.

    ```
    Some function signatures have changed in v0.14.x. See [this PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-MPC-Project/pull/3) for more details.
* Fortran Compiler
  * Mac: `brew install gcc` (might not be required)
  * Linux: `sudo apt-get install gfortran`. Additionall you have also have to install gcc and g++, `sudo apt-get install gcc g++`. Look in [this Dockerfile](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-MPC-Quizzes/blob/master/Dockerfile) for more info.
* [Ipopt](https://projects.coin-or.org/Ipopt)
  * If challenges to installation are encountered (install script fails).  Please review this thread for tips on installing Ipopt.
  * Mac: `brew install ipopt`
       +  Some Mac users have experienced the following error:
       ```
       Listening to port 4567
       Connected!!!
       mpc(4561,0x7ffff1eed3c0) malloc: *** error for object 0x7f911e007600: incorrect checksum for freed object
       - object was probably modified after being freed.
       *** set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug
       ```
       This error has been resolved by updrading ipopt with
       ```brew upgrade ipopt --with-openblas```
       per this [forum post](https://discussions.udacity.com/t/incorrect-checksum-for-freed-object/313433/19).
  * Linux
    * You will need a version of Ipopt 3.12.1 or higher. The version available through `apt-get` is 3.11.x. If you can get that version to work great but if not there's a script `install_ipopt.sh` that will install Ipopt. You just need to download the source from the Ipopt [releases page](https://www.coin-or.org/download/source/Ipopt/).
    * Then call `install_ipopt.sh` with the source directory as the first argument, ex: `sudo bash install_ipopt.sh Ipopt-3.12.1`.

* Simulator. You can download these from the [releases tab](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases).
* Not a dependency but read the [DATA.md](./DATA.md) for a description of the data sent back from the simulator.


## Basic Build Instructions


1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./mpc`.

## Tips

1. It's recommended to test the MPC on basic examples to see if your implementation behaves as desired. One possible example
is the vehicle starting offset of a straight line (reference). If the MPC implementation is correct, after some number of timesteps
(not too many) it should find and track the reference line.
2. The `lake_track_waypoints.csv` file has the waypoints of the lake track. You could use this to fit polynomials and points and see of how well your model tracks curve. NOTE: This file might be not completely in sync with the simulator so your solution should NOT depend on it.
3. For visualization this C++ [matplotlib wrapper](https://github.com/lava/matplotlib-cpp) could be helpful.

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/b1ff3be0-c904-438e-aad3-2b5379f0e0c3/concepts/1a2255a0-e23c-44cf-8d41-39b8a3c8264a)
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
